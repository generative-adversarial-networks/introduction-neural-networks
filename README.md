# Introduction to neural networks

This repository includes a series of *python* codes to introduce the user to the main concepts about **Neural Networks**.
These examples are part of my webinar/presentation about this topic. The presentation can be found here.

#### Setup
The neural networks introduced here are implemented from scratch and using basic operations. There is no need for any kind of specific python packages, but *numpy*.

An easy way to install this dependency is using the environment file included in ``./auxfiles/`` folder, ''./auxfiles/nnenv.yml'' by using *conda*.

```
conda env create -f ./auxfiles/nnenv.yml
source activate nnenv
```

It could be done by running the following command and using the **nnenv** environemt (as it follows):
```
source activate nnenv
```

Or by installing  *numpy* using *pip* or *conda* in your system:

**conda**
```
conda install numpy
```
**pip**
```
pip install numpy
```


##### Conda
```
conda env create -f ./src/helper_files/environment.yml
source activate lipizzaner
```

##### Pip
```
pip install -r ./src/helper_files/requirements.txt
